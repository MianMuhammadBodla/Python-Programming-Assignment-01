# Calculate Powers of Numbers.

# Task: Given two integers base and exponent
# Compute base raised to the power of exponent.
# base:int = 3
# exponent:int = 4
# Expected Output:
# Power result: 81


# Solution:

base:int = 3
exponent:int = 4

compute = base ** exponent

print(f"Power result: {compute}")
