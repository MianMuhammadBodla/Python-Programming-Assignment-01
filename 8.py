# Convert an integer to its binary representation

# Task: Given an integer num
# Obtain the binary representation of num
# num:int = 45
# Expected Output:
# Binary representation : 0b101101


# Solution:

num:int = 45

Binary_representation = bin(num)

print(f"Binary representation : {Binary_representation}")
